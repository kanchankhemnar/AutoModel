# :gear: Machine Learning Tasks Overview

Machine Learning (ML) enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. The core ML tasks are grouped into the following categories:

---

## :brain: Supervised Learning

The model learns from labeled data (input + known output).

Includes:
- :dart: Classification : Predict categories or labels
- :bar_chart: Regression : Predict continuous numeric values

Examples:
- Predict whether a student passes or fails (classification)
- Predict house price (regression)

---

## :mag_right: Unsupervised Learning

The model explores the structure of data without labeled outputs.

Includes:
- :triangular_ruler: Clustering : Group similar data points together
- :link: Association : Discover relationships between variables (e.g. Apriori algorithm)

Examples:
- Grouping customers based on purchase behavior
- Finding frequently bought-together products

## :recycle: Reinforcement Learning (Beyond Scope)

The model learns by trial and error using rewards and penalties.  
Used in robotics, gaming, simulations.

In AutoModel, we primarily focus on Supervised
