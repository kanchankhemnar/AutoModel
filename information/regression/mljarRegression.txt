# :rocket: AutoML for Regression (MLJAR)

MLJAR AutoML automates the full regression model lifecycle â€” from preprocessing to model training, tuning, and evaluation.

---

## :bar_chart: What It Does

- Automatically detects data types & handles preprocessing
- Trains multiple regression models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Extra Trees
  - XGBoost / LightGBM (if supported)
- Selects best model based on RÂ² score and RMSE
- Generates a detailed visual report with:
  - Leaderboard
  - Boxplots
  - Residual plots
  - Feature importance

## :bulb: When to Use

- When you want quick model comparisons without manual tuning
- To find the best baseline model before deeper optimization
- When you're not sure which regression model will perform best

---

## :warning: Keep in Mind

- MLJAR may skip unsupported models if libraries aren't installed
- Not suitable for huge datasets (use cloud-based tools instead)
- Works best with clean numeric data

AutoML saves time and gives solid insights â€” especially helpful for beginners and time-sensitive projects! ðŸš€
