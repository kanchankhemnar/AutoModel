# :vertical_traffic_light: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM is a powerful algorithm that finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) between classes.

Good for:
- High-dimensional data
- Binary or multiclass classification

Key points:
- Works well when classes are separable
- May struggle with noisy data
- Supports different kernels (linear, RBF)
